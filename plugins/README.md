# Appium Inspector Plugin

```bash
# Install from local directory. Then, please run 'npm run build:plugin' as well.
appium plugin install --source=local /path/to/appium-inspector/plugins
```

> [!Note]
> Appium 3 will support this plugin as a first-class plugin with `appium plugin install inspector`

## Usage

1. Start Appium server with the inspector plugin enabled:

```bash
appium --use-plugins=inspector --allow-cors
```

2. Access the Inspector interface by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:4723/inspector
```
