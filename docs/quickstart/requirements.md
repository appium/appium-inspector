title: System Requirements
---

Since the Inspector is released in [3 versions](../overview.md#formats), the requirements for these
will differ:

- Desktop app
    - Works on Windows 10+, macOS 11+, Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian 10+, openSUSE 15.5+, or Fedora Linux 39+
        - [These requirements are taken from Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7100626),
          as the Inspector is built using Electron (which uses Chromium)
    - Up to around **600MB** of free space is required
    - The minimum application window size is **890 x 710** pixels
- Web app/Appium server plugin
    - Works in Chrome/Edge/Firefox, released in 2022 or later
      ([Safari is not supported](../troubleshooting.md#browser-version-does-not-work-in-safari))
    - The plugin version requires around **9MB** of free space
    - Viewport size of at least **870 x 610** pixels is recommended

All Inspector versions also require an **Appium server** to connect to, which can be hosted either
locally or remotely. For instructions on how to install and set up the server, please refer to the
[Appium documentation](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/quickstart/install/). Make sure to also
install the necessary [driver(s)](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/drivers/) for your
target platform(s).

Continue with the [Installation](./installation.md) steps, or jump directly to
[Starting a Session](./starting-a-session.md)!
