## Update Checker

The update checker is available under the _File_ menu (Windows/Linux) or the application menu
(macOS). It can be used to check if there is a newer version of the Inspector available, and if so,
it is possible to automatically download and install the latest version.

Updating is supported for the following application formats:

- macOS: `.dmg`
- Windows: `.exe` installer
- Linux: `.AppImage`
