title: Server Details
---

The top of the Session Builder screen is used to configure server details - that is, how the
Inspector should connect to the target Appium server.

By default, the _Appium Server_ tab is selected, which is used for connecting to a standalone local
or remote Appium server. However, it is also possible to connect to a server provided by a cloud
service. [See the section below for more details.](#cloud-providers)

## Default Server Detail Fields

The default server details have 4 fields:

![Default Server Details](./assets/images/server-details/default-server-details.png)

- **Remote Host**: the host URL of the server
- **Remote Port**: the port on which the server is running
- **Remote Path**: the path used to access the server. Appium 2 servers use `/` by default, whereas
  Appium 1 servers use `/wd/hub`
- **SSL**: by default, the server is accessed over HTTP - tick this checkbox to use HTTPS

If using the placeholder details, the Inspector will try to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:4723/`.
If you have a locally-running Appium 2 server that was launched with default parameters, it should
also be using this address, in which case you can leave the fields unchanged.

## Cloud Providers

Clicking the _Select Cloud Providers_ button opens a screen with various cloud providers that
support integration through Appium Inspector:

Selecting any provider then adds a new tab next to the default _Appium Server_ tab, and switching to
the provider's tab changes the available server detail fields. Different providers will have
different fields - for example, LambdaTest only requires the _username_ and _access key_:

## Advanced Settings

The _Advanced Settings_ options allow further configuration of the Appium server connection:
